# RPSGame
A very simple game (Rock, paper, scissors) that I made inspired by this video: https://youtu.be/DyqMglmrido?feature=shared
I built this code when I was starting to learn Java Swing some months ago :)

Interface using Swing and the game logic consists in a generated value provided by the class Random, so you can use
equals() method to compare the content of the player´s move and CPU´s move (random choice between the index of the array)
